  Descriptions:
  - Unknown Description
  - Some Temtem are naturally introverted and keep to themselves. DEF +1.
  - Really? Are you going to attack something *this* cute? You deserver that ATK -1.
  - 'The substance known as Urushiol is a virulent toxic agent. Synergy: +4 turn poison.'
  - Lashing gales, like the frozen tramontane howling over Loch.
  - Almost any claw or nail can scratch the surface. Sometimes that's enough.
  - Many Temtem have this habit of gently chewing plants or furniture. This is a little
    less gentle.
  - Effective and unsubtle, like a Tucmani mine drill.
  - A fistful of humble sand becomes a faceful of dirty fighting
  - The red mist makes a Temtem brutal (ATK +2) but also careless (DEF -2)
  - Raw as untamed Temtem and unstopabble as a Kisiwan stampede
  - All beaked Temtems like to playfully peck their tamers. This is the less friendly
    version.
  - This Temtem's intimidating stare makes rivals feel more vulnerable (DEF -1).
  - A mind hack developed by Arubian Mind specialists, makes the target asleep for
    2 turns.
